The time of payment of the price shall be of the essence of the Contract. Receipts for payment will be issued only on request.</li>

                <li>Where the Goods are to be delivered in instalments, each delivery shall constitute a separate contract and failure by the Seller to deliver any one or more of the instalments in accordance with these Conditions or any claim by the Buyer in respect of any one or more instalments shall not entitle the Buyer to treat the Contract as a whole as repudiated.</li>

                <li>If the Buyer fails to take delivery of the Goods or fails to give the Seller adequate delivery instructions at the time stated for delivery (otherwise than by reason of any cause beyond the Buyer’s reasonable control or by reason of the Seller’s fault) then, without limiting any other right or remedy available to the Seller, the Seller may store the Goods until actual delivery and charge the Buyer for the reasonable additional costs (including insurance) of storage and redelivery of the Goods.</li>
